Hi, I have done my best to make the react app, i have got know about many things while working on this assessment and it was fun
i had issue were i was not able to implement responsive design as the media queries i learned were not working and i searched on the internet about media queries and it's bit long to learn and implement with minimum given time, but i'll learn it by tommorow.
and I got stuck were i have to hover and display the Learn More text on image but as you can see in the project i just implemented it without hover and also i have had a issue during implementing modal popup as in react i have no idea how to access modal but i have designed the modal as it is.
thankyou for giving me this opportunity and please comment how to implement these functions and components.
